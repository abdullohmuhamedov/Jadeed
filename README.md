# Jadeed
Jadeed system is a tool used by schools to manage and analyze data related to students, staff, and other key stakeholders. The system helps schools to streamline administrative processes, improve communication with stakeholders, and make data-driven decisions.

One important aspect of a Jadeed system is the ability to track and manage student grades. This process involves recording and analyzing student performance in various subjects and assignments, and assigning grades accordingly. The CRM system enables teachers and administrators to efficiently manage grades and provide accurate and timely feedback to students and parents.

The system allows for real-time updates and tracking, ensuring that grades are up-to-date and accurate. It also enables schools to generate reports and analytics that provide insights into student performance, such as identifying struggling students who may need additional support.

The grading system typically includes letter grades or numerical scores that are assigned to assignments or courses. The grades are usually based on a variety of assessments, such as exams, essays, projects, and homework assignments. Teachers use grading rubrics to ensure consistency and transparency in grading.

The accuracy and timeliness of grading are essential for students to be able to monitor their progress, take corrective actions, and seek help if needed. It also helps parents to stay informed of their child's academic performance and identify opportunities for additional support or enrichment.
